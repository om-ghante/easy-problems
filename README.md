# Easy Problems

Welcome to **Easy Problems**, a repository designed to help you practice and improve your programming skills through a curated collection of problems. Currently, this repository focuses on **C Programming**.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on the programming language.

### `c-problems/`
This directory contains sets of C programming problems. Each file represents a collection of problems, often increasing in complexity or grouped by topic.

- **[1.md](c-problems/1.md)**: **Beginner** level problems. Focuses on basic input/output, arithmetic operations, and simple logic (e.g., Addition, Even/Odd).
- **[2.md](c-problems/2.md)**: **Intermediate** level problems. Focuses on conditional statements (`if-else`), divisibility checks, and basic mathematical logic (e.g., Profit/Loss, Grade Calculator).
- **[3.md](c-problems/3.md)**: **Advanced** level problems (relative to basics). Involves more complex logic, nested conditions, and real-world scenarios (e.g., Simple Calculator, Leap Year, Electricity Bill).

## Problem Format

Each problem file follows a consistent structure to help you practice effectively:

1.  **Problem Title & Tag**: Identify the problem and its difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
2.  **Problem Description**: A clear statement of what needs to be solved.
3.  **Test Cases**: Input/Output examples to verify your solution.
4.  **Flowchart**: A visual representation of the logic flow using Mermaid diagrams.
5.  **Answer**: A hidden code block containing a sample solution in C.

## How to Solve Problems

1.  **Navigate** to a problem file (e.g., `c-problems/1.md`).
2.  **Read** the **Problem Description** carefully.
3.  **Write** your code in your local C environment.
4.  **Test** your code using the provided **Test Cases**.
5.  **Compare** your logic with the **Flowchart**.
6.  **Check** your solution by clicking **"Click to View Answer"** to reveal the reference code.
